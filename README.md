## Applied AI on AWS — Indus AI Week

Hands-on AI Training for Future Engineers
Powered by INIT  (AWS Official Partner)

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains the official hands-on lab material for the
“Applied AI on AWS” training delivered during Indus AI Week.

The training is designed for final-year Computer Science students and focuses on practical, real-world use of Generative AI on AWS, not theory alone.

All exercises are:

✅ Beginner-friendly

✅ Production-inspired

✅ AWS-native

✅ Non-commercial & educational

## 🎯 Training Objectives

By completing these labs, participants will learn:

How modern AI assistants are built using AWS Bedrock

How voice interfaces work using Speech-to-Text

How enterprises use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

How AI systems are designed safely and realistically

This training emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and correct architecture.

## 🧠 Learning Path (Progressive)

The repository is structured into three hands-on exercises, each building on the previous one.
